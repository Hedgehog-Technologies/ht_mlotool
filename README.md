### Usage

#### Dependencies

- [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)
- [CodeWalker](https://github.com/dexyfex/CodeWalker)

#### Quick Start Usage Guide

1. Launch into your FiveM server
   - preferably a dev environment, but you do you
2. Place your player ped inside of the MLO that you want to work with
3. Use the `/openmlo` command
   - Note that by default this requires being a part of `group.admin`
4. Go room by room through the MLO setting values as you see fit
   - Closing the UI will cache your changes locally, **no need to generate the files everytime you close it**
   - The resource should detect which room you are currently in and default to that room when you open the UI
   - *Note* - You can press and hold `right mouse button` with the UI open to be able to move around
5. Press the `Generate Audio Occlusion Files` and wait for confirmation of generated XML file(s)
6. Use [CodeWalker](https://github.com/dexyfex/CodeWalker) to convert the XML files to the proper GTAV format
7. Move the converted XML files to a FiveM map resource
8. Restart your FiveM server and enjoy occluded audio goodness
