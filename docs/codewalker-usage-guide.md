# CodeWalker Usage Guide

This is meant as a guide for the post-generation import steps that will take the user out of GTA and into CodeWalker.

[CodeWalker](https://github.com/dexyfex/CodeWalker) is an app that renders the GTAV map and allows users to work with game content files. The most up-to-date release can be downloaded from the [CodeWalker Discord Guild](https://discord.com/invite/BxfKHkk).

## Usage Steps

1. Open CodeWalker and expand the side menu by pressing the `<<` button in the top right

3. Once the RPF Explorer is loaded up, open the folder that you want the parsed output files to save to
   - `File -> Open Folder...`
   - *Note:* This doesn't have to be the final destination of the files

4. With the chosen folder open in the RPF Explorer turn on `Edit Mode` but pressing the `Edit Mode` button near the top of the RPF Explorer Window
